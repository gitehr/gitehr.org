# Overview

GitEHR has been designed to solve the problems inherent to medical records and to be extensible in the future.

It aims to use low-tech solutions and be completely reliable.

Natively, GitEHR is a technical standard that no clinician would use directly. It is a foundational technology upon which other systems can be built. These higher-level systems will focus on improving clinical workflows.

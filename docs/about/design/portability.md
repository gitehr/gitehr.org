# Portability

Portability is a natural emergent property of complete [Patient-Centricity](patient-centricity.md). It is therefore baked into GitEHR.

When the files of a record are represented in a single directory on a disk, they can be shared easily with other caregiving organisations.

They can even be downloaded onto a portable storage medium, like a USB stick. This can be read, updated and used comprehensively in this state. A prime example includes if the patient goes off-grid because they are on an expedition or a colony ship to Mars. Later, changes made can be merged back into the record.

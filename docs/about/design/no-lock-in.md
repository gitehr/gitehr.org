# No Lock-In

GitEHR is engineered to be an interoperable file format for clinical records, free from **Vendor Lock-In**.

Vendor Lock-in is a well-known term in the technology industry. It describes the result of data tied inherently to a specific product.

One mitigation is interoperable file formats. For example, the `.odf` or `.docx` file formats allow one to use a different editor software, if the current becomes unaffordably expensive, without providing sufficient value.

In healthcare - and governmental IT in general - vendor lock-in seems to be a particular problem: *there are no interoperable file formats*. Even basic data in simple IT systems is wholly linked to the database schema of the software used.

**Vendor lock-in leads to problems throughout the entire software lifecycle.**

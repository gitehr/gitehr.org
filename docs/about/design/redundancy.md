# Redundancy

Every organisation providing care to a patient keeps a complete copy of their entire GitEHR healthcare record. Health records are small in the context of modern data management.

All organisations to which a patient is granted access keep an up-to-date record copy.

Distributing the storage of medical records makes them extremely resilient to loss, deletion or corruption.

# The Tale of Databasechester

This story serves to illustrate the conclusions of why #DatabasesAreHarmful and #FilesAreTheAnswer.

## A long time ago, there was a large kingdom called Databasechester.

In this land, the concept of a document file format *did not exist*. Each organisation kept their internal documents inside a database, inside its organisation. Excluding the slight problem they were still locked into their IT systems' vendor, this solution worked fine *inside each organisation*.

One day, the Local Council wish to send documents to the Fire Department! Unfortunately, the Fire Department possesses a different document management database. The Council were forced to commission the development of magical software to *transmute* Council documents into Fire Department documents.

Though costing a LOT of gold, this solution worked fine. But the Council's system had some bespoke features which can't be accurately represented in the Fire Department's system. This data was sadly lost in the transmutation, termed by the magic folk as a "lossy translation". But in the end, after years of work and kilos of gold spent, most of the Council's documents can be transferred to the Fire Department!

Another day, the Fire Department wish to send documents to the Local Council! This was a completely unforeseen affair. The Fire Department is forced to commission the development of magical software to transmute Fire Department documents into Council documents. After even more years of work and kilos of gold spent, the Local Council and Fire Department can accomplish the previously thought impossible task of *communicating* with each other.

Another day, the Police Department wish to send documents to the Local Council *and* the Fire Department! After many years and exorbitant amounts of gold, Databasechester has a system in which all three organisations can communicate with each other. The kingdom got poorer, whilst the magic software people got richer.

As the days go by, more and more organisations wish to send documents: yet another completely unforeseen affair! Even creating the magical transmutation software rapidly requires more work and gold. It results in more lossy, poor-quality communication.

No one in the surrounding kingdoms was surprised that Databasechester achieved very little, despite spending inexplicable amounts of gold to solve an exponentially growing interoperability problem.

**The End.**

Is this familiar to anyone working in health tech?

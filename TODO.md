### TODO list

native FHIR and openEHR (yes both)
built-in version control
EPRs can focus on competing around UI/features
completely breaks the paradigm of vendor lockin
Forensics: view the record exactly as it appeared at any point in past, with cryptographic proof of the veracity of the entries
non-repudiability
problems we may encounter because it's SO GOOD - it becomes so easy to share your entire medical record that insurance companies can request full access to it, when they probably should not be allowed -

#### Military/Battlefield health records

During the course of deployment, a single individual may be deployed to different areas and be cared for in different hospitals, and each of those may have separate systems. So, using a single file-based electronic health record provides complete interoperability between any of these platforms. A new individual could arrive with an offline, but fully up-to-date copy of their entire medical record on a USB stick, and this could be introduced into the live record for the place that they are going to be working for that period of time. And at the end of that period, the record can be exported in entirety and taken with that individual to the next posting. None of which requires special interoperability to be created between the disparate systems. They just all have to be able to interact with a gitEHR record.

#### Natural Disasters

Similarly, in situations of natural disaster or other major medical incidents, being able to record fragments of care in a way that is gitEHR compatible means that, at a later date, when perhaps the full identities of the individuals are known, those individual care episodes and the records of those can be reintegrated back into their existing record. Generally, that would require appending just a few new files to the end of their existing medical record.
